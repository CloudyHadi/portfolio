## About

My journey has led me to specialize in a unique combination of skills and tools that power my projects:
- **JS Framework**: I love working with **SvelteKit**, a modern and efficient JavaScript framework that enables me to build stunning and performant web applications.
- **UI Library**: For crafting sleek and responsive user interfaces, I turn to **SkeletonUI**. Its simplicity and flexibility align perfectly with my design philosophy.
- **CSS Magic**: I harness the power of **Tailwindcss** to create visually appealing and consistent styles that enhance the user experience.
- **Backend Brilliance**: **Pocketbase** serves as my backend of choice, allowing me to develop robust and scalable applications with ease.
